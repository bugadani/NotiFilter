Do you have a smartwatch or a fitness tracker? You want to receive notifications but the constant buzzing annoys you? Then NotiFilter may be something that can help!
NotiFilter is a simple Android app that assumes you only need a single notification per source. NotiFilter remembers which apps notified you so far and stops the same
notification source to bug you constantly.

An example: you use Messenger, or any other messaging app[^1]. NotiFilter will make sure that you only receive notifications of the first message of each of your contacts.

NotiFilter clears its internal state when you turn your phone's screen on, and also won't relay notifications when you use your phone. Sounds good? Give it a try!
